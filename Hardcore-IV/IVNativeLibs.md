# IVNativeLibs - I will change the name back to what it was/is.
This is [ClonksCodingLib.GTAIV](https://github.com/ClonkAndre/ClonksCodingLib.GTAIV) for GTA IV made by ClonkAndre.
This was Edited a bit for easy use and may get more modified in the future for Global use as well. Might update the main Repo later.

Currently there are many stuff needs to be added. Might add the stuffs like ScriptHookDotNet adds, Model, Ped, Vehicle, Weapon, Animations, Pickup... so on Classes.
